I made this website to showcase some of the sewing projects I have done over the past couple years. I wanted to create a simple space for them to be easily viewable to look back on, like a visual diary, or to show friends or family. 

Briefly describe the 5 pages you created for your site.
1. Home page
    This landing page serves as a home base and informs the user about the purpose of the site. Other personal hobbies are also listed above an image of the thread peg board I recently made for my "sewing station".
2. Wallet
    This page showcases the wallet I made and how it has held up after almost two years of use. (I will be washing it soon!) 
3. Zipper bags
    This page shows 3 zipper bags I created as presents for my family. I detail fabrics, textures, and colors of the pieces in a table below the images. 
4. Patching Jeans
    This page shows an arrangement of alterations I have made to a pair of my own jeans and a pair of my friends that skateboards and often rips up their jeans.
5. Free motion
    This page highlights a lesser known sewing technique. I briefly explain what it is, and showcase a couple of examples of how I have used in practice. 

What were the HTML elements you used and why did you choose them?
- Header: Sticky to top to easily swtich pages or go to home.
- Nav: Easy navigation between pages.
- Footer: Fake copyright and email for contact
- img: For visuals of the sewing projects
- section: Boarder sections (ex. images vs text)
- div: For stlying image layouts.
- Table: To overview used fabrics, colors, and textures selected for zipper bags. 

What CSS styles did you apply to change the visual design of those HTML elements?
- I changed font style, color, size, and the background color of all pages as well as font.
- I customized buttons with the javascript features to highlight where interactivity on the page is.
- I changed the header nav links and footer link to my email font color and size to be cohesive with the page style.
- I changed size and arrangement of all images on each page encorporating a different overall design and orientation while keeping consistent general design theme choices. (ex. fig captions are all italicized, dates are included as p under headers h3)
- each page has a footer image of a section of the thread pegboard image displayed on the home page.

Provide a link to the W3C CSS validationLinks to an external site. for your front-page.
